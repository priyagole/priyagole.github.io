Hi there! I am Priya, a fourth-year undergraduate in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at IIT Kanpur. I have a wide range of ever-evolving interests. I love learning about new tech and enjoy reading about random stuff here and there.

Currently, I am interested in Data Science, primarily in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and I am exploring NLP. Also, I find Mathematics fascinating, particularly Number Theory and its real-world applications in Cryptography.  

Feel free to email me if you wish to collaborate.
