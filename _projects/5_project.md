I did this project in my first year of college.  
This project was done under Stamatics, Mathematics Department. It was aimed at introducing Number Theory and its application in Cryptograpy.

Outcome:  
- Worked on understanding algorithms like Euclid’s
Algorithm & it’s consequences like Bezout’s Identity.
- Learned about special primes like Fermat and
Mersenne Primes and learned basic primality tests
and distribution of primes and related concepts.
- Explored the idea Congruences, and related theorems
like Chinese Remainder Theorem & its applications.
- Learned about the real-world applications in
Cryptography like the RSA Encryption.

The field of Number Theory left me fascinated. I still enjoy reading about it here and there.  
In my second year, I (with my friend Abhishek) mentored a similar project [Number therory and its applications](https://abhishekshree.xyz/number-theory-applications/) which covered slightly broader spectum.
