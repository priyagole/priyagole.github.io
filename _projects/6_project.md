This project was done under Programming Club, Science and Technology Council. The project was aimed at introducing the basics of Machine Learning.  

Outcomes:
- Got introduced to the basic libraries used in data science like Numpy, Pandas, Mathplotlib, etc.
- Learned how to observe a dataset and analyse it. Got an insight on how to pre‑process the dataset effectively like when to
scale/standardize data for a model, how to deal with highly corelated features, when to label encode and when to one‑hot encode
etc.
- Learned and implemented different Regression, Classification and Clustering models; learned linear models like Linear, Ridge
and Lasso Regression and non‑linear models like KNN, SVR, Naive Bayes, Random Forest and LightGBM.
- Implemented everything learned in a Hackathon hosted on Zindi.
