## About Application

The application was made as a course project of [CS253A](https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/isaha/Courses/sdo22.shtml/): Software Development and Operations in spring 2022 under the guidance of [Dr. Indranil Saha](https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/isaha/).

The application, **store-it** aims to be a one-stop solution for the various service providers and stores operators at IITK to catalog their products and services. The residents of IITK can access these online catalogs and place orders directly from the app. Think of it like a platform that digitizes any physical store inside IITK. Broadly, the application will support the following:

- Stakeholders can put a catalog of their products/services.
- Students can add items to their cart and place orders
- Stakeholders can update their inventory and prices.
- Students can get their transaction history, and stakeholders can get their sales history.

**Clients**: IITK Vendors and Campus community
