This project was a part of course assignment of the course CS202 (Logic).

The project consists of 2 parts:  
1. Sudoku Pair solver 
- Implemented a python program to solve a sudoku pair
(with an additional constraint that corresponding cells in
pair canâ€™t have the same value) using PySat.
2. SAT solver
- Made a SAT Solver using DPLL Algorithm.
